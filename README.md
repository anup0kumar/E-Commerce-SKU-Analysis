## Problem Statement

You are working as a consultant with consumer brands like Kelloggs, Logitech, Kimberly Clark, grow their e-commerce revenue on Amazon, Walmart, and other retailers using data insights, machine-learning-backed recommendations and automated actions.
The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into SKU performance and sales trends over a specific time period. The analysis will:

    1. Identify the most expensive SKU on average.
    2. Determine the percentage of SKUs that generated revenue and identify those that stopped selling after July.
    3. Detect the dates of significant sale events.
    4. Evaluate whether these sale events led to a cannibalization of sales immediately afterward.
    5. Analyze category and subcategory growth, focusing on the slowest-growing subcategory within each category.
    6. Highlight any anomalies or mismatches in the data.
    7. Investigate whether unit conversion rates (units sold/views) for a specific SKU are influenced by its average selling price.
This analysis will help in understanding pricing strategies, sales dynamics, and areas of concern in the product portfolio.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load the data files ("Sales_Data.csv" and "Glance_Views.csv") into Power BI Desktop.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options to check the data integrity.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present .
- Step 5 : Filter the data to exclude any negative or zero values in "Ordered_Revenue" and "Ordered_Units" for accurate revenue analysis.
- Step 6 :Use a line chart to visualize daily sales trends and identify the highest sales day within each month. Identify dates with peak sales, suggesting a potential sale event, and analyze whether these events cannibalized sales in the subsequent days.
- Step 7 : Used matrix to show the percentage revenue generated through each category in each month followed by subcategory.
- Step 8 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for three fields named "Feed_Date(only Months)", "Category" & "SubCategory".
- Step 9 : Five card visuals were added to the canvas, one representing total Revenue, sum of ordered units, %sku revenue per month, unit_per_view & Most expensive SKU.
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & negative revenue values were unselected for consideration into average calculation.
           
           Although, by default, while calculating average, blank values are ignored.
- Step 10 : Summarize key insights from the dashboard, including top-performing SKUs, periods of peak sales, 
 
- Step 11 : Calculated column was created  which representing SKU Category in order to understand the revenue generated by each sku category.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;
       
        SKU_Category = LEFT(Sales_Data[SKU_NAME],1)

- Step 12 : New measure was created to find Most Expensive SKU.

Following DAX expression was written for the finding the average selling price and for most expensive sku.

        Average Selling Price = DIVIDE(SUM('Sales_Data'[Ordered_Revenue]),SUM('Sales_Data'[Ordered_Units]))
        
        Most Expensive SKU = TOPN(1,VALUES(Sales_Data[SKU_NAME]),[Average Selling Price],DESC)

        
A card visual was used to represent sum of revenue.

 - Step 13 : New measure was created to find  units per view,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find units per view,
 
        Unit_per_View = DIVIDE(sum(Glance_Views[UNITS]),sum(Glance_Views[VIEWS]))
 
 A card visual was used to represent this perecntage.

 - Step 14 : The report was then published to Power BI Service.

# Insights

A Two page report was created on Power BI Desktop .

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### [1] Total Revenue Contribution
  
Highlight the percentage of revenue contributed by the top SKU categories based on the first letter of the SKU name.

           
### [2] SKU Performance
Identify the most expensive SKU on average and track its sales performance over time.
Determine which SKUs stopped selling after July, providing insights into product lifecycle management.
  
  ### [3] Inventory Management
Analyze REP_OOS data to identify SKUs that frequently go out of stock, indicating either high demand or supply chain issues.

 ### [4] Sales Events Impact
Pinpoint the dates of significant sales events and analyze their impact on subsequent sales, identifying any cannibalization effects.

 ### [5] Category Analysis
In page 2 Compare subcategories within each category to identify the slowest-growing subcategories and recommend areas for improvement and many more insights extracted from the data.
